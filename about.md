In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
* [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)

## Scribal

Move faster, create new value, challenge established ways of working.  You need to innovate.  Let’s face it: It is not easy to evolve a digital-first business.  But at the same time it’s not exactly optional, is it?

Digital transformation isn’t just meant to be undergone.  It’s supposed to speed things up, create new value, and push a growth agenda by leveraging advanced software technologies in the cloud. We’re Scribal and we’re here to help you move forward through change.

## Our Philosophy

innovation as a social process...works better through an on-going conversation about constraints and possibilities...
the cloud as a new way to access and utilize resources of all kinds...
data as an asset with latent value... which needs to be 'liberated' in order to be useful...
boundaries force constraints that need to be remedied....

(some basic ideas that could be in the form of blog entries instead.)
