*Netscape's IPO roadshow provides insight and premonition about the value of these strategies* 

<!--excerpt--> 


One moment in the lore of internet history came during the run-up to Netscape’s 1995 IPO.  Jim Barksdale and other executives participated in a roadshow to educate investors.  Going from city to city, country to country, they finally come to London, the very last stop.  Though exhausted, the team puts in a nice presentation.  The crowd is engaged.  Inquiries begin to flow from the audience.  Eventually, Barksdale says "I have time for one more question."  A man in the room speaks up: “How do you know that Microsoft isn’t just going to bundle a browser into their product?”

Great question.  Barksdale's reply was something between a joke and an aphorism.  “Well gentlemen," he said "I know of only two ways of making money.  Bundling and unbundling. I have an airplane to catch, so thank you very much.”  

We hear of bundling a lot these days.  Sometimes the concept seems a bit mysterious or vague.  The punch line never seems to come.  But all bundling means is to combine separate elements into one.  Bundling only becomes technical later, when we consider what these separate things are and how they might be integrated together.  Even so, there are advantages to understanding bundling and unbundling in basic generalities the way Barksdale did.   


Essentially, business value creation involves two ideas: making distinctions and making connections.  When one hears the word “Suite” as in the Microsoft Suite or Netsuite, one is hearing about connecting separate products.  Presumably this conjunction provides more meaning and greater value than maintaining product distinctions at a lower level.  A suite is a type of bundle, and product bundling has been been around a long time.

But when Facebook buys Instagram, or when [Salesforce buys Slack](https://www.scribal.io//2020/12/07/salesforce-slack/), or when hundreds of small companies are acquired by a few tech juggernauts, this is also just a way of combining or connecting previously separate elements.  It’s bundling.  Sometimes business combination serves to make possible a larger set of products, often complementary ones.  At other times it is a way of aggregating subscribers to feed an existing offering to a larger audience or to achieve network effects.  It seems odd to think of customers or Big Tech companies themselves as ‘bundles’, but Barksdale seems to have given us permission.  So why not?  We have more specific terms for a business form such as a conglomerate, or a competitive strategy, such as vertical or horizontal integration but basically it comes down to the same idea of connecting things to obtain some kind of advantage.  

Then there is distinction making, ie unbundling.  This trend is equally as important but less talked about.  Unbundling is often happening in the same industry sectors at the same time, and for the same ultimate purposes.  The spin-off of a business, the decoupling of products, the quest to build value through specialization.  

In enterprise software there exists both large suites and smaller, best of breed providers.  As software has moved to the cloud, we find new entrants succeeding with narrower focus in  better defined segments.  Many of their innovative products were once thought to be pieces of larger product suites, not independent areas in their own right.  [CPQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configure,_price_and_quote) was once ho-hum bills of materials and configure-to-order features of ERP packages.  Now CPQ as a domain is an example of unbundling, even if it is (ironically) software intended to help you make bundles.  Best of breed software is unbundled software, and so are most SaaS startups.  Unbundling is part of the process of advancing industries and defining new categories.  

If only business success boiled down to a simple choice between x and y, right?  Still, Jim Barksdale’s quip - intended to escape a run-over meeting - turns out to be a useful insight.  We hear of bundling all the time.  It's not a mysterious idea but it's a powerful and broad one.  So is unbundling.  These are alternatives that exist at a high level.  The real devil lurks in the details, in the implementation.  In future posts I’ll get into a case or two, and see what there is to learn.
