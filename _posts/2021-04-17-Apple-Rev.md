*How Steve Jobs changed software revenue recognition with the introduction of the iPhone*

<!--excerpt--> 

“Phone differentiation used to be about radios and antennas and things like that. We think, going forward, phone differentiation will be about software.”  This is what Steve Jobs said at the launch of the iPhone.  One of the best product launches of all time.  The ultimate dream come true, right?

Turns out releasing the product was just one part of what Steve needed to accomplish with the iPhone.  He also needed to convince a skeptical investing public of what he had just done.  He needed them to understand the economics of what the iPhone was proving out.  And that part was an unexpected nightmare. 

The nightmare arose from a seemingly abstruse issue: the company’s revenue recognition policy for the new product.  As Apple's CFO explained at the time, "Since we will be periodically providing new software features to iPhone customers free of charge, we will use subscription accounting and recognize the revenue and product cost of goods sold associated with iPhone handset sales on a straight line basis over 24 months." 

It's another example of how no good deed goes unpunished.  

From an accounting point of view, “free” is a concept that belongs somewhere else.  Marketing, for example.   Apple’s iPhone revenue policy was therefore designed to convey the real economic meaning of “free” upgrades.  By [GAAP](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gaap.asp) standards at the time, the provision of free upgrades in the future meant something.  It suggested that the company hadn’t completed the earning process when the iPhone device was initially purchased by an end user.  Instead, it meant that Apple had outstanding obligations to provide upgrades to users over the course of their estimated contract life of 2 years.

The policy, based on GAAP, meant that only a fraction of unit sales could appear in the company’s income statement in the period when they occurred.  These sales were instead piling up as deferred revenue on the balance sheet, casting an overly modest light on the iPhone’s unprecedented early progress.  During the 2008 time frame, Apple’s stock price declined to less than half its pre-iPhone value.  That’s pretty amazing.  The accounting policy made it harder for investors understand the emerging business at a critical juncture in Apple’s history.  It prevented the true story of the iPhone getting out.

So what did Steve Jobs do about the nightmare?  He did two things.  First, he presented non-GAAP revenue in a rare earnings call appearance, bringing attention to the limitations of GAAP subscription accounting in understanding iPhone revenue.  And secondly, he pressed Apple’s concerns with standards setting bodies, resulting in a change to US GAAP [known as the "Apple Rule"](https://cfo1.wordpress.com/2009/10/14/eitf-issue-09-3-certain-revenue-arrangements-that-include-software-elements-aka-the-apple-rule/).  

Sometimes in today's digital world, it is challenging to show the economics of what you are accomplishing with your products.  This is particularly true when software and hardware are bundled together, or when you give customers some kind of beneficial element for free.
