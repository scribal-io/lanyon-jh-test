*After trouble communicating the success of the iPhone, Steve Jobs helped change GAAP revenue recognition standards*

<!--excerpt--> 


**“Phone differentiation used to be about radios and antennas and things like that. We think, going forward, phone differentiation will be about software.”** - Steve Jobs

Great thought.  Unfortunately, the investing public was not won over by Steve's declaration.  And they weren't convinced by the [1m units sold in the first three months](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/15/technology/15apple.html).  In fact, Apple's stock declined to less than half its value in the year after its debut. 

We are used to thinking of the iPhone as one of the greatest product launches of all time.  But it was more complicated for Steve Jobs and the Apple Finance team.  They had to present salient facts to skeptical investors about the  meaning of their innovation.

The communication problem arose from the company’s revenue recognition policy for the new product.  As Apple's CFO explained at the time, "Since we will be periodically providing new software features to iPhone customers *free of charge*, we will use subscription accounting and recognize the revenue and product cost of goods sold associated with iPhone handset sales on a straight line basis over 24 months." (Italics mine)

From an accounting point of view, *free* is a concept that belongs somewhere else.  Marketing, for example.   Apple’s iPhone revenue policy intended to bring out the real economic meaning of *free upgrades*.  By [GAAP](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gaap.asp) standards at the time, the provision of free upgrades in the future had to be interpreted a certain way.  It implied that the company hadn’t completed the earning process when an iPhone device was initially purchased by an end user.  Instead, it meant that Apple had outstanding obligations to provide upgrades to users over the course of their estimated contract life of 2 years.

The policy, required under GAAP at the time, meant that only a fraction of unit sales could appear in the company’s income statement in the period when they occurred.  These sales were instead piling up as deferred revenue on the balance sheet, casting an overly modest light on the iPhone’s unprecedented early progress.  The accounting policy made it harder for investors understand the emerging business at a critical juncture in Apple’s history.  It prevented the true story of the iPhone getting out.  It made it harder for the public to make an intelligent investment decision and bet on the future of the company.

So what did Steve Jobs do about the revenue reporting nighmare?  He did two things.  First, he presented non-GAAP revenue in a rare earnings call appearance, bringing attention to the limitations of GAAP subscription accounting in understanding iPhone revenue.  And secondly, he pressed Apple’s concerns with standards setting bodies, resulting in a change to US GAAP [known as the "Apple Rule"](https://cfo1.wordpress.com/2009/10/14/eitf-issue-09-3-certain-revenue-arrangements-that-include-software-elements-aka-the-apple-rule/).  

It is challenging to show the economics of what you are accomplishing with your software-defined products even now.  This is particularly true when software and hardware are bundled together, or when you give customers some kind of beneficial element for free.
