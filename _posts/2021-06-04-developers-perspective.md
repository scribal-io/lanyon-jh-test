title: Apple's iOS App Store and Subscriptions
---

*An influential iOS app developer has chimed in on some key issues raised in Epic Games v Apple. In addition to locking in fees as high as 30% of an app's revenues, Apple owns "the customer relationship between all iOS users and each app they choose to use."* 

<!--excerpt--> 

Marco Arment is one of the best known indpendent app developers for the Apple iOS platform. Generally, his postions with respect to the company are well-reasoned and moderate. So when Arment [wrote a blog post last week blasting Apple's app store policies](https://marco.org/2021/06/03/developer-relations), the app development world took notice.

Arment's ire is based on two axiomatic points: 

* Apps add value to the iOS platform and to Apple's corporate well-being far beyond the fees that they collect from the App Store.
* App usage and revenues are correlated to developer reputation and marketing much more so than to discovery mechanisms within the App Store itself.

Arment points out that under current iOS policies -

>Apple further extends the value argument, and defends their justification for forced commissions, by claiming responsibility for and ownership of the customer relationship between all iOS users and each app they choose to use.

I will repeat that because it is so important yet mentioned very little in analysis of the Epic case: **Apple owns all customer data related to apps in the app store. It can share with developers what it chooses to share.**

Arment further argues that -

> This argument only makes sense — and even then, only somewhat — when apps are installed by a customer browsing the App Store, finding an app they hadn’t previously heard of, and choosing to install it based on App Store influence alone.

> But in the common case — and for most app installations, the much more common case — of searching for a specific app by name or following a link or ad based on its developer’s own marketing or reputation, Apple has served no meaningful role in the customer acquisition and “deserves” nothing more from the transaction than what a CDN and commodity credit-card processor would charge.

As we asked about software subscribers in our previous post -

> Are they subscribing to a product experience like a game, agnostic to the means of delivering the experience?  Or, are they subscribing to a platform that guarantees that the experience will be available, reliable, and secure?

As a longtime consumer of Apple's software ecosystem (like many other developers), I'd argue that to some extent we are subscribing to both things. But I also agree with Arment's final point on this score -

>It isn’t the App Store that has enabled all of the commerce on iOS — it’s the entire world of computing and modern society, created by a symbiotic ecosystem in which Apple played one part alongside many others. The world was already moving in this direction, and had Apple not played its part, someone else would’ve. The App Store is merely one platform’s forced distribution gateway, “facilitating” the commerce no more and no less than a web browser, an ISP or cellular carrier, a server-hosting company, or a credit-card processor.
