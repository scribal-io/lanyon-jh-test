title:  Epic, Apple and the Subscription Economy
---

*Epic Games vs Apple is providing a window onto changes that widespread adoption of subscription commerce has made to our economic markets.* 

<!--excerpt--> 

Epic Games vs Apple is the highest profile and most important antitrust case of 2021. Epic, creator of the popular game, Fortnite, has contested Apple's power to enforce the 30% cut it takes from sales in the iOS app store. When Epic released a version of Fortnite which contained pointers to Epic's own online store (where it doesn't have to pay Apple any percentage at all), Apple quickly barred the game from the iOS app store.  In court, Epic has argued that Apple is abusing its position as the owner of the platform and is taking a percentage of revenues unjustified by the benefits the app store provides. Apple responds that its policies protects all users because it reviews every app in the store to ensure that they meet standards pertaining to usability, security and protecting data privacy.

Less noted is the fact that the trial is happening amidst a rapidly growing app economy. As noted by the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/behind-the-epic-apple-trial-is-a-booming-app-market-worth-fighting-over-11621157405?mod=series_epicapple), the number of iOS app developers has increased by nearly 400% between 2015-2020. While Apple does not break out detailed AppStore metrics, its Services division (including AppStore) [grew 27% between Q1 of 2020 and 2021. It is now the second largest part of Apple by revenue, after the iPhone itself, and ahead of things like the Mac, iPad and Apple watch](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/apple-services-revenue-tops-16-9-billion-4175371/).

Also unremarked: app revenues these days are mostly recurring subscriptions. If you have an iPhone, take a moment to review your AppStore purchases. While many  apps are free, it's highly likely that most of the rest are for services you pay to use on a recurring basis.  Companies offering subscriptions and an iPhone app have two payment choices: 1) get paid via the app store and pay Apple's cut as specified or 2) offer a free app with content accessible only to subscribers, but which does not enable any purchases and also does not "steer" users to any external website where items can be purchased. Some larger tech companies like Netflix and Amazon offer Apps with no in-app payment, but those companies are prominent and deep-pocketed enough to acquire customers through other means.

For the most part, the public has accepted the fact that many items that we used to own outright are now licensed to us for our use over a specified period of time (or, less commonly, up to a certain quantum of usage).  But selling subscriptions in a world of dominant platforms is a complex affair. Should platform gatekeepers get to keep a cut in perpetuity - Apple takes 30% for a subscription's first year and 15% thereafter? Should they be able to prevent other companies from selling renewals directly through their own sites. Does the platform have a right to sell bundles of subscriptions and determine the revenue share from those bundles? Should companies like Apple or Google be able to run an AppStore and at the same time compete with other companies on the same platform? Think about Apple Music and Spotify: Apple Music doesn't have to pay AppStore fees, but Spotify does (or would if it offered in-app payments). What about selling virtual currency on the app store (as Epic used to): should the commision structure apply and who determines when the revenue will be recognized? There are a lot of subscription-related questions to be sorted out.

The consensus of most observers of this trial is that Epic's claim is unlikely to succeed. One sure thing is that the rapid growth of the "app economy" and the extension of the subscription model into many new areas is changing commerce forever.
