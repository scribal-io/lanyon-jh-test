title: Introducing Lanyon
---

Gregory is an unassuming [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) person that places content first by tucking away navigation in a hidden drawer. 

### What We Believe

Poole is the Jekyll Butler, serving as an upstanding and effective foundation for Jekyll themes by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo). Poole, and every theme built on it (like Lanyon here) includes the following:

* Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, [404](/404), [RSS feed](/atom.xml), posts, and [example page](/about))
* Mobile friendly design and development
* Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS
* Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements
* Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post
* Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)

### What We Do

We can help you with:

* Data utilization
* Leveraging community developments to support your business
* Co-development programs


### What We Say

Scribal is dedicated to helping people solve the most pressing problems they face in the workplace.  Every day.  And all through the night.
