title:  Substack's Opinionated View of Digital Media
---

Nathan Baschez, one of the movers behind the newsletter consortium, *Every*, and previously an early employee at Substack, recently wrote a post entitled [*The Ideology of Substack*](https://every.to/divinations/substack-s-ideology) which makes important points about subscriptions.

In the post, Baschez observes that prior to launching Substack's founders diagnosed two central problems of digital media:
- Advertising  - "which rewards publishers for attracting attention." And
- Engagement Algorithims - which engender virality based on emotions such as outrage.

According to the post, the Substack team hypothesized solutions to each problem:
- Paid subscriptions instead of advertising  and
- Email inboxes replacing algorithmically generated content feeds.

I want to focus here on the two central problems and suggest that digital media can be situated, correspondingly, on two axes:
- an Axis of Monetization (with advertising on one side and subscriptions on the other); and
- an Axis of Discovery (algorithmic on one side and organic/curated on the other)

This is easier to draw than to explain in words, so here's how this coordinate system looks with several prominent contemporary media companies placed on it.

We find Substack on the extreme upper left of the coordinate grid - it accepts no advertising, relies 100% on subscription revenue, and doesn't have any form of newsfeed or other algorithmic discovery.  There likely are other similar properties, but, offhand, I can't think of any. Substack is by far the most ardent proponent of this opinionated view of how digital media should work.

Another company which has been loudly promoting its reliance on reader subscriptions is the New York Times. Not only do the NYT website/apps have a paywall, but content that used to be given away with the physical paper such as food recipes and the crossword puzzle have been spun off as independent subscriptions. Its recent announced acquistion of the subscription sports journalism site, *The Athletic*, possibly foreshadows a world where the NYT sports section is a paid add-on subscription rather than part of the traditional paper.

As any subscriber who uses the Times apps or website knows, stories are pushed at users algorithmically. On occasions where I see "dead tree" edition of the paper, I'm always surprised that I see bylines of writers who I assumed had left the NYT and topics that I rarely see online.  And despite the fact that subscriptions to the paper, Food, and Puzzles apps cost several hundred dollars per year, the NYT still targets me with advertising whenever I use its apps.

For all of these reasons I have situated the NYT on the extreme upper right of the grid: heavily dependent on subscription revenue, but also on advertising. And probably because of the advertising, they are algorithmically promoting articles which generate the most clicks.

Many other media companies are located closer to the orgin (0,0) point of the coordinate system. That's because these days its rare for these companies to be entirely dependent on either subscriptions or on advertising.  Even Meta, which invented the concept of the Newsfeed, enables subscriptions within its most valuable products, Facebook and Instagram.  And most companies, lacking the enormous resources of the NYT or Facebook rely on a mixture of algorithms, curation and old-fashioned publicity to promote discovery of their content.
