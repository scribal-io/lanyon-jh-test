## Finance As A Service

### Saas Product Finance
Saas is driven by non-gaap measures such as net dollar retention rate, MRR, ARR, etc, which have no standards and which are therefore clouded often by infrastructure capabilities and limitations rather than economic realities.  At least at some large enterprises.  Garbage.

The notable feature is the movement away from gaap measures to non-gaap measures to assess performance.  This then creates a disconnect when acquiring or building a product and grafting it into a public company setting which requires gaap.

### Revenue Recognition
Has changed largely due to the economics of software firms that bundle offerings together.  Very different than previously.
