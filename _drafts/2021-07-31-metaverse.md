*The metaverse is having a moment. What does that mean for subscriptions?*

<!--excerpt--> 

The word "metaverse" is having a "moment."

Term comes from scifi. It was coined in 1992 and has been a recurring motif.

What does it mean?
- online experiences that are so immersive that, in the words of Nvidia's CEO, “We’ll be able to almost feel like we’re there with each other.”

Lots of other connotations:
- experiences will be interoperable i.e., it will be possible to cross-over from one 'experience' to another
- multi-platform - so builds on the concepts of the mobile internet
- some game-like interactions (perhaps because to-date the most immmersive online experiences have been games
- VR/AR hardware - sometimes required

Building blocks of the metaverse:
- mobile devices
- vr/ar hardware
- cloud computing
- machine learning
- interoperability
- payments/subscription infrastructure

How close are we to acheiving this? Watch this space?
