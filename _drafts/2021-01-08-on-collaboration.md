title: On Workplace Collaboration 
---

What are ‘workplace collaboration tools’?  Is email a collaboration tool?  What about google sheets - is that a collaboration app?  Hows about attending an in-person meeting? is that somehow less a type of collaborative experience than joining a Zoom call?  Yes, yes and no, not really.  

All that *collaboration* really means is co-laboring or working together. There’s nothing special about it.  It’s something we have always been doing and always will be doing.  So if you have built a ‘collaboration tool’, don’t describe it that way.  It tells us exactly nothing.  Just say that you ‘have a tool that allows you to save a document in the cloud that other people can modify’ if that is what your tool happens to do.  Tell us what it does.  And tell us what problem it solves.  Don’t worry so much about what it supposedly ‘is’. Conversely, if you are a buyer, look to solve particular problems that cause you pain, not categories that universalize the ordinary into a  quasi-spiritual principle.

Here are a few examples of collaboration tools, applications, and platforms, stated differently:

- **LinkedIn** creates a valuable forum around jobs and the workplace - it helps employers and job seekers make connections.
- **Github** allows individuals, teams and organizations to develop and share code. 
- **Twilio** enables companies to easily interact with customers, partners and others through SMS.
- **Twitter** and **Facebook** provide an ability to advertise to and engage with customers through their social media platforms.
- **Stack Overflow** makes it possible for developers to get answers to their questions and to share knowledge with others.  

Looking beyond the feel good buzzwords of ‘community building’ and ‘collaboration’: each of these tools show its value better when described in terms of what it actually does.  Some don't even fit our imagined list of what collaborative tools are.  Point is: let’s not allow buzzwords act as a kind of mystification that blocks our way in understanding what is available to address specific problems.  Then we can find the best possible paths to alleviating those issues that really need addressing.
